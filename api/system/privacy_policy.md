## Storage of browser data

Generally, when you visit a website, information is automatically stored for technical reasons in server log files that your browser transmits to us. This information consists of:

    IP address
    access status (http status code)
    amount of data retrieved
    date and time of the server request
    referrer URL


### Data collected upon registering

Upon registering, the ITS collects the user data as: 

	IP address
    access status (http status code)
    date and time of the server request
    referrer URL
	login name
	hashed passwort used for the login
	hashed email (only used to send the recovery token)

Because after issueing the access and recovery tokens the email addresses are not saved, please make sure to save the token in a safe place, should you need to recover your account.

### Data collected upon login

	IP address
    access status (http status code)
    date and time of the server request
    referrer URL
	login name

These collected data are used for purposes of identification and to detect unauthorized attempts to access the web server and cannot be assigned to a specific individual. A comparison with other databases or a disclosure to third parties does not take place.

### Data collected during interactions with the system (after login, the data is linked to the respective login name)
	
	code snippets (digit-based collection)
	answers to the multiple choice questions
	usage of feeback, run and submit functions
	date and time of the server request
	results of the questionnaires
	
This data is used for the functioning of the system (for example, to suggest a hint, the system needs to use the current state of the code), however, we would also like to use this data for the research (in an anonymized form). To consent to the scientific data collection, you can
check respective field in the user profile. Please note that you can withdraw your consent at any point.  

## Processing

Ag KML collects and processes the above-named data and log files required for the technical operation of the website in order to safeguard the technical security of the systems and ensure the functionality of the ITS. 
The processing of additional data via forms and web-based services shall only be lawful if the data subject has given consent pursuant to Art. 6 para.1 lit. a. of EU GDPR or is necessary for the performance of a task carried out by Bielefeld University pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e. in conjunction with the Higher Education Act of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (HG NRW).

### Data transfer

As a matter of principle, we do not pass on personal data which is processed during a visit to the ITS's internet pages to third parties. 
In some circumstances, this may be necessary if we are required by law to do so, for example, transmission to criminal prosecution authorities to clarify criminal offences within the framework of the provisions of the German Code of Criminal Procedure (StPO) or for the purpose of asserting claims for damages in the event of copyright infringements. 
Where technical service providers have access to personal data, this happens on the basis of a contract pursuant to Art. 28 of EU GDPR.
No personal data is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area and associated countries (no third country transfer). If this should become necessary you will be informed.

The anonymized system interaction data (if consented to) will be used for research and scientific purposes and might be published in the form of an anonymized archive, hence the following application and use of the data are not known.


### Your rights as a data subject

As a data subject, you can assert the rights granted to you by the EU-GDPR at any time, insofar as these apply to the data processing:

* The right of access by you as the data subject to obtain confirmation of whether and which data concerning you are being processed (Art. 15 EU GDPR);
* The right to request rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data pertaining to you (Art. 16 EU GDPR)
* The right to erasure of your personal data in accordance with Art. 17 EU GDPR
* The right in accordance with Art. 18 EU GDPR to obtain restriction of data processing;
* The right to object to the future processing of your personal data in accordance with Art. 21 EU GDPR.

In order to operate and maintain the web services of the ITS it is necessary that we collect data and store data in log files. Users may therefore not object to this. Although IP addresses may be regarded as personal data, the ITS does not assign them to individuals. 
Because of this, the University cannot fulfil a request by the user for information as there is no IP address associated with them.

In addition to the aforementioned rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the respective data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 EU GDPR).

### Validity of this privacy statement

We reserve the right to amend our privacy policy, in order to adapt to changes in relevant laws and regulation and to better meet your needs as the user of our website.
