# Information for participants

Thank you for your interest in the training with out Intelligent Tutoring System. In addition to the Data Protection statement, we would like to provide you with some additional information about the system, how it works, and what participation implies. 

## Goals of the ITS

In the WS2024/2025, our research group – AG „Knowledge Respresentation and Machine Learning“, officially represented by Prof. Dr. Benjamin Paaßen, offers additional exam preparation materials for the „Introduction to Data Mining“ within this ITS. These tasks are not mandatory for course completion, and they do not include exclusive information, that was not presented during the lectures. Nevertheless, we hope that these additional tasks may help you explore the topic of Data Mining in more depth, as well as help you consolidate the knowledge from the lectures and other materials. 

**Please note that interaction within this ITS as well as donation any of the data for scientific purposes is completely optional and in no way will affect the examinations of the aforementioned course. That is, choosing to interact (or not interact), with or without completion of any activities within this ITS, with or without donating data for scientific purposes, will have no impact on the course performance. Still, we hope that additional materials provided in this ITS can be helpful for you to consolidate knowledge acquired throughout the semester.**

The detailed description of the data can be found in Privacy Policy. Please note that the interaction data in collected for the system funcionality. However, we would also like to use the data collected within the ITS for research purposes. Upon the registration, the system will ask you to either opt in or opt out of data collection for scientific purposes: this choice is yours to make and will not lead to any disadvantage for you. In case you prefer not to allow usage of your data for scientific purposes, please be aware that the data will still be collected and saved for the purpose of maintaining system’s functionality, but will be exculded from any evaluation or analysis in the future, and irrevertably deleted after the 31.03.2025.
This consent is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time by notifying Bielefeld University. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out based on consent before its withdrawal. 

Additionally, within the system we provide questionnaires (learning personality and feedback), data from which we would like to use for research and to improve the ITS. Participation, as well as data donation, are optional for all users.
