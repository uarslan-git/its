# Guassian Mixture Models

Gaussian Mixture Models is useful tool for clustering.

An example input dataset here would be the [Iris Dataset](https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7) from sklearn.
Each row contains following features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, species. 
Where the first 4 columns would be numerical and the last one would be the clustering target. 

Write a function that would use GMM to determine the best number of clusters and return this number.
