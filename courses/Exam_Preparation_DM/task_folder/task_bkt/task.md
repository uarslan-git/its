# Bayesian Knowledge Tracing

Let the data be an array of size $n$ of the passes (1) and fails (0) of a specific student, while learning a specific skill. 
Recall the formula of the probability of the skill acquisition by a student and implement it.

Your function should output an array of size $n$ of probabilities that the student has mastered the skill.
