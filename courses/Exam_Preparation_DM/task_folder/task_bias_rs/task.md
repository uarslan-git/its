# Biases in Recommender Systems 

Recommender systems are prone to many biases, which can affect the quality and utility of the items presented to users. On different occasions, the biases of the underlying algorithms can lead to unwanted effects, such as echo chambers, filter bubbles, homogenization of the recommendation, or even a severe polarization of the opinions in society. 

While mitigating all potential biases is a very complicated (if not impossible) task, it is important to keep being aware of the potential misconceptions in the recommendation to be able to prevent mistakes and their amplification. 

Please choose the statements on the right, that are true.
