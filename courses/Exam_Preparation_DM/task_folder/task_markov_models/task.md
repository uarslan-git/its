# Markov Models

A Markov model is a mathematical model for a system that undergoes transitions between different states. 
The defining characteristic of a Markov model is the Markov property, which states that the future state of the system depends only on its current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. 
That is, the system is "memoryless" regarding the previous interactions.
