This folder contains the tasks for the Intro to DM exam preparation. 
The tasks are separated into different topics: 
ST - statistical testing; main probabilistic concepts and methods. 
FA - factor analysis; comprises PCA, FA, Clustering and GMM
IRT - item response theory; main models, parameters, concepts.
KT - knowledge tracing; performance factor analysis, BKT, etc. 
ML - machine learning; components from VAE, deep learning, pytorch competencies. autoregressive models? 
RS - Recommender Systems; concepts, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, counterfactual learning (maybe)
Critical Thinking: applying the knowledge acquired to problems and assessing suitability of the chosen method

NB: we need to ensure the similar difficulty distr in the first section, to investigate the novelty effect. 


ST competencies: NLL optimization, signed rank test, conditional probability, non-linear (spearman) correlation. 
FA competencies: differences between PCA and Factor Analysis, latent space prediction, agglomerative clustering, silhouette score interpretation, GMM algorithm
IRT competencies: logistic regression, models and parameters, building ICC, interpret results
KT competencies: Hidden Markov Models, PFA, assessing plausibility of the predictions, EM algorithm
ML: differences between AE and VAE, RNN vs LSTM, convert data for DKT format
RS: cosine similarity, collaborative filtering (item-wise), matrix factorization aspects
CT: assess problems with a specific approach/suggest a methods to work with the data. (MC based)


ST tasks: mean_and_std, pooled_variance, nll_functions, pearson, wilcoxon
FA tasks: pca_fa, agglomerative_clustering, gaussian_mixture_clusters, gmm_vs_kmeans, 
IRT/KT tasks: IRT_logreg, param1_2, bkt
