# Case Study: KT and IRT. 

Let there be an online adaptive learning platform designed to help students enhance their mathematics skills. 
The platform includes a set of interactive quizzes and exercises tailored to individual needs and specific skill acquisition. 
The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the platform in terms of accurately assessing students' abilities and providing adaptive feedback.

What models and why would you implement in such a setting?
