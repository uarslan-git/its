Traditional statistical analysis techniques, such as linear regression or basic clustering algorithms, might not be suitable for capturing the complex, non-linear relationships present in the data when dealing with student learning styles. Learning preferences can be highly individualized and may not adhere to linear patterns.",

Utilizing more advanced techniques, such as neural networks, including Variational Autoencoders, allows for the capturing of non-linear relationships in the data. These models can learn intricate patterns, providing a more accurate representation of individual learning styles and supporting the creation of personalized educational experiences."]
