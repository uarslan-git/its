# Basic variables and their types

## Variables
There are several types of variables in Python. There is no specific comand for declaring it: a variable is created at the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5
y = "I am a variable!"
print(x)
print(y)
```
```
5
I am a variable!
```
## To Do

The command **type()** can help you determine the type of the variable in question. Write a function  **what_are_you** that will be printing out the type of input (please do not forget to use the **print()**)

```python
def what_are_you(something):
    ...
```
Now, try out your function on "chocolate", 542, 40.666, True
