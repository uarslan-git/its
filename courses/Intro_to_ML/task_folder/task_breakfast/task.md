# Breakfast


In this task, you have to define a function called "breakfast"

```python
def breakfast(sentence):
    ...
```
As an input ("sentence") you will be receiving a string with products, like: "ham, fruit, orange juice". 
Within your function: 
1. Translate the string into a list of products (**hint**: split the string by comma)
2. Append an irreplacable product ("coffee") to the breakfast list with .append()
3. Extend the list to accomodate people who prefer leftovers from the previous evening ["pizza", "noodles"] with .extend()
4. Find out the length of the product list you have created. 
5. Create a new list with the first 2 products from the list you have created. 
6. Find out the lengths of the products in the new list and calculate their sum ((**hint**: you can use a loop for this)). 
7. Add "coffee" to the beginning of the new list with .insert()

For the input in the example above, the following output is expected: 

```
5, 8, ["coffee", "ham", "fruit"] 
```
You will mention, that there is 6 products mentioned in the task, but there is only 5 expect as an output. Why would it be so?
