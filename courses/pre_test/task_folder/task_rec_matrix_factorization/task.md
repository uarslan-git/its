# Matrix refactorization

Consider the following rating matrix.

|          |   movie 1 |   movie 2 | movie 3   | movie 4   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| user 1   |         2 |       1   | -1        |           |
| user 2   |        -1 |      -0.5 |           | 1         |
| user 3   |         1 |       0.5 |           | -1        |
| user 4   |        -2 |      -1   | 1         |           |
