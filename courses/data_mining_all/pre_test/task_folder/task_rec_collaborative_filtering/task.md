# Recommender Systems: Collaborative Filtering

Consider the following rating matrix.

|          | movie 1   |   movie 2 | movie 3   | movie 4   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| user 1   | 9         |         7 | 3         |           |
| user 2   |           |         4 | 6         | 7         |
| user 3   | 7         |         6 | 4         |           |
| user 4   | 1         |         3 |           | 9         |
| new user |           |         6 | 4         |           |

Given a collaborative filtering approach, which movie would you recommend to the new user?
