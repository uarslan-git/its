# Variance Coverage

Write a function that receives as input an $N \times m$ data matrix `X` as well as an integer `n` and returns the fraction of variance covered by the first `n` principal components.

Recall that this is equivalent to the sum of the first `n` eigenvalues divided by the sum of all eigenvalues.
