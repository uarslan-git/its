# K-means

Implement one iteration of the K-Means algorithm.

The input of your function is a current matrix of prototypes `Mu` (with one row per cluster) and a data matrix `X` (with one row per data point).

Your function should return a vector `assignment`, where `assignment[i]` is the index of the cluster data point i is assigned to, and a new matrix of prototypes `Mu`.
