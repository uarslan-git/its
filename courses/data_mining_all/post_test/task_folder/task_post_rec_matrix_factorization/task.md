# Recommender Systems: Matrix Factorization

Consider the following rating matrix.

|          | movie 1   | movie 2   | movie 3   | movie 4   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| user 1   | 2         |           | -1        | -2        |
| user 2   | -1        | -0.5      | 0.5       |           |
| user 3   |           | 0.5       | -0.5      | -1        |
| user 4   | -2        | -1        |           | 2         |
