# Basic Variables 2
## Types of variables: type()

In the previous task, you could play around with different variable types: integers, strings, floats, bools, etc. 

```python
c = 2.5
print(c)
print(type(c))
```
```
2.5
<class 'float'>
```

```python
d = True
print(d)
print(type(d))
```
```
True
<class 'bool'>
```


## To Do
In Python, you can also specify a type of variable through casting. For example:

```python
y = str(3)
print(y)
print(type(y))
```
```
3
<class 'str'>
```
Write a function, that for each integer *n* will be returning 3 new values: as string, integer, and float.
Please use following format:
```python
def variables(n):
    ...
```
