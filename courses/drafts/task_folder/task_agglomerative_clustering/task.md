# Agglomerative Clustering

Concisder an input data to be a set of the point on the plane (2D points in an array). 
An example:

Recall the agglomerative clustering from the lectures. On of its differences to the Kmeans is that it does not require a predefined number of clusters. 
In this task, please implement an algorithm for the agglomerative clustering with the euclidean distance and ward linkage. 

The functions for them, as well as a search for nearest clusters are already implemented.
