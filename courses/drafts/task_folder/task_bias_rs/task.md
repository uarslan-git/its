# Dimensiionality reduction and latent spaces. 

## Poisson Distribution

During the course, we have investigated several techniques for the dimensionality reduction and finding latent representations of the data given. 
Among them, the typicall approaches would be Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA).
