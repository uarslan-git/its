# Thanks a lot for finishing the learning personality survey!

We hope that your answers will help us understand better the way people learn, and help to adjust the teaching to the future learners!

If you now changed your mind and do not wish to share your questionnaire answers anymore, you can also indicate so with your answer (please note that processing of the request can take a bit of time), or through requesting the data deletion as indicated in Data Privacy Statement..

We wish you could luck with further exercising and hope that the system will be helpful to you in learning. 

Best wishes, 

Curious Camel Team.
