# Learning personality questionnaires.

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this survey!

We have a hypothesis, that some personality traits and preferences can affect the way people learn, as well as help detect the times while learning, when support is required. Hence, we would like to collect your response for testing this hypothesis, and potentially train our system to support you better.

This survey consists of three two major questionnaires: Short inventory for Big 5 Traits, Problem Solving Strategies, and Learning preferences.  

When presented with a question, please choose exactly 1 answer in the response field. 

Please be aware, that you can opt out of this survey at any point without any disadvantage to you.
